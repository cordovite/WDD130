        Basic car maintenance, excluding the engine, involves a range of essential tasks that contribute to the overall health and longevity of your vehicle. Start by regularly checking tire pressure and inspecting the tread for signs of wear, as proper tire maintenance ensures optimal fuel efficiency and safe handling. Keep the exterior clean and waxed to protect the paint from harsh elements and corrosion. Regularly replace windshield wiper blades to maintain clear visibility during rainy conditions. Check and replace the air filter to ensure efficient airflow to the cabin. Additionally, inspect and maintain the vehicle's battery, ensuring clean connections and replacing it when necessary. Keep an eye on the brake pads and replace them if they are worn down. Lastly, stay updated with scheduled maintenance tasks outlined in your car's owner's manual to address any specific maintenance needs for your vehicle.

            Brakes and Chassis
        </h2>
        <p>
            Basic car maintenance on brakes and chassis is vital to ensure a safe and smooth driving experience. To start with the brakes, regularly check the brake fluid level and top it up if necessary, following the manufacturer's recommendations. Inspect the brake pads and rotors for wear, replacing them if they are worn beyond the recommended thickness. Additionally, keep an eye on brake hoses and lines for any signs of leaks or damage. When it comes to chassis maintenance, perform routine inspections for signs of rust or corrosion, especially in areas prone to exposure, and take prompt action to address any issues. Grease the chassis components, such as ball joints and tie rod ends, to reduce friction and maintain their longevity. Regularly cleaning the undercarriage can also help prevent dirt and debris buildup, which can accelerate corrosion. By incorporating these simple yet crucial maintenance practices into your routine, you can keep your brakes and chassis in excellent condition, promoting road safety and prolonging the life of your vehicle.
