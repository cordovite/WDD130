        Hi! My name is Alex Cordova and I am from Long Beach, California. I am currently studying software engineering. I haven't decided on a focus yet but I'm mostly leaning towards a career in cybersecurity.

        Some of the things I like to do is hiking and camping. I like exploring and investigating locations I have never been to before. I like going on night drives and traveling. Something I also like to do is play video games with the boys. It is a great way to pass time. I am not marrried and I'm not planning on that soon until I'm sure of how school goes. I currenlty do not have a job but I am looking for some jobs here in Rexburg even though it is hard to find one. I have worked with customer service for 3 years now so the experience helps when going job hunting.

        One of the things that I love about BYU-Idaho is how cheap it is for how much education is available. It is a great place to go to especially for the amount of opportunities you have to learn and get to interact with others. I am pursuing a Bachelors Degree. This course will help me reach that goal. I am taking this course mainly becuase it is requires for my major, but I am seeking to learn how html and css works and how to combine the two to make an effective site. The things that I learn in this course will eb beneficial in my personal life becuase it will be what my career focuses on. Also, I can do various things with the knowledge of learning how to make websites. It is something I look foward to exploring and mesisng around with.

        I have been a member of the church since I was 10 years old. We were all baptized by missionaries four months after they knocked on out doors.
